/**
 * Write a class called Line. It represents a single line on the Cartesian plane, and stores two Point
 * objects (its start and end points), as well as a double representing the length of the line. The class
 * should also have the following methods:
 *
 * 1. A static method double lineLength(Point start, Point end) which returns the
 * distance between the two given points
 * (using the mathematical formula ((x2 - x1) ^ 2 + (y2 - y1) ^ 2) ^ 0.5)
 *
 * 2. A default constructor which has both its start and end at the origin (0, 0), and has a length
 * of 0.
 *
 * 3. A constructor which takes two Point objects and stores them as the start and end points. It
 * should also store the distance between these two Points.
 *
 * 4. Point getStart() and Point getEnd() which return the start and end Points of the
 * Line, and double getLength() which returns its length.
 *
 * 5. void moveStart(float deltaX, float deltaY) which moves the Lineâ€™s start Point
 * by the given values. Also write void moveEnd(float deltaX, float deltaY) which
 * does the same for the end Point. (Hint: you may find the Point.movePoint method
 * useful).

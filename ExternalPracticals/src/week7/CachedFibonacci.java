    /* A brief explantion of what on earth is going on here...
     *
     * When calculating a fibonacci number recursively, you end up doing the same calculation again
     * and again and again. For example,
     * Fib(4)   = Fib(2) + Fib(3)
     *          = Fib(2) + Fib(2) + Fib(1)
     * To calculate the 4th fibonacci number, you calculate the second fibonacci number twice.
     * (This gets exponentially worse as you go above 4) Now obviously the second fibonacci number
     * is going to be exactly the same each time you calculate it, so why bother doing all that
     * work over and over again?
     *
     * Enter caching...
     *
     * This class uses a (hand written) LRU cache to store the last few calculations of fibonacci
     * numbers it did. Every time you ask it for a fibonacci number, it will first check if that
     * number is within the cache. If it's within the cache, we can return it immediately without
     * doing the work to calculate it. It it's not in the cache, we actually need to figure it out,
     * but then we can put it in the cache so that we don't need to calculate it again next time.
     *
     * But what is LRU?
     *
     * When you're caching the return value of a function, there comes a point where you need to
     * stop. The int type can go from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1, and we don't have enough ram to store
     * every one of those fibonacci numbers. Because we keep adding things to the cache every time
     * we do a calculation, we also need to start removing things from the cache so it doesn't
     * explode. LRU - short for Least Recently Used - is a caching heuristic that says when we
     * need to remove a number from the cache, we go for the number that was looked up last. The
     * idea is that if it hasn't been looked up in a while, it probably won't be looked up again
     * soon.
     *
     * How does this implementation of an LRU cache work?
     *
     * Our cache is stored as two arrays (of the same length). The cacheKeys array contains the
     * last few inputs given to our calculate function. The cacheValues array is defined so that
     *
     * for all i such that 0 <= i < cacheKeys.size
     *      cacheValues[i] = calculate(cacheKeys[i])
     *
     * Because the fibonacci sequence is only defined for positive numbers, we will use -1 to
     * signify any extra space in the cache that hasn't been used yet. This is in place of null,
     * because ints are primitive types and therefore cannot be null.
     *
     * In the cacheKeys array, we say that the most recently used keys are at the start of the
     * array, and the least recently used keys are at the end.
